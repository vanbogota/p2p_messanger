## instructions

Start signaling-сервер (node signaling-server.js).
Make sure that in app.js the server address matches where it actually runs (ws://localhost:3001).
Open the app in multiple browsers/devices - all participants will automatically connect with each other and messages will be sent to everyone.
Change the environment variable SIGNALING_SERVER_URL when deploying.
